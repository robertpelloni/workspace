```

### Using Serena MCP for Memory Management
```bash
# Store important information in Serena memory with hierarchical organization
mcp_serena_write_memory --memory_name "claude_insights" --content "Key insights from Claude analysis"

# Retrieve stored information with context awareness
mcp_serena_read_memory --memory_file_name "claude_insights"
```

- **Simple Tasks**: Single model approach (Claude or faster alternative)
- **Progressive Escalation**: Start with efficient models, escalate to Claude when complexity warrants

### 2. Enhanced MCP Server Usage
- **Serena**: Hierarchical memory (immediate/project/cross-project) with automatic context tagging
- **Chroma**: Enhanced semantic search with code-aware chunking and contextual filtering
- **Zen**: Dynamic routing with confidence-based validation and quality gates

### 3. Specialized Use Cases (Consensus-Validated)
- **Architecture Analysis**: Claude excels at system design and architectural decisions
- **Security Audits**: Strong at identifying vulnerabilities and security best practices

- **Complex Reasoning**: Deep reasoning tasks, algorithmic optimization

### 4. Optimized Collaboration Workflow
```
1. Task Classification: Determine complexity and routing needs
2. Primary Analysis: Claude performs initial analysis (if high complexity)
3. Quality Gates: Automated validation (syntax, tests, security)
4. Validation: Cross-check with specialized models if confidence < threshold
5. Storage: Save results in Chroma with structured metadata
6. Memory: Update Serena with key insights and decisions
```
