I am currently evaluating all the major AI models, CLI tools, IDEs, IDE plugins, and MCP servers. My ultimate goal is to configure them all together in order to create a super powerful mega AI which communicates between several models and orchestrates multiple models and tools together in parallel, in order to debate, brainstorm, and assign tasks and work as a team maybe with subagents, hopefully in order to produce better ideas and results. Currently I am starting with codex CLI, please check its configuration. The config files are listed in the nppsession file. I believe it is having MCP timeout errors due to environment variable whitelisting. Please try to correct this in the config file and Cursor's settings. Codex seems to want to use WSL, which is fine but I need help configuring it in that case. Powershell and cmd are also both fine. I would then like to move on to more CLI tools, trying to make sure that each CLI tool and IDE has access to as many models as possible, that they all are configured with the same MCP servers and tools, and that they all work if possible, and they are able to call out to all other major models in several ways and use the other CLI tools, and also utilize all the MCP servers and tools when and where useful. Ultimately I want to use this super development AI team to help me to complete FWBer and then move on to more projects. Please begin with codex and bypass the environment variable whitelist somehow so that it can access the tools in its config file. Please also suggest any other tools, techniques, CLI tools, IDE, model, or especially MCP server which you think would be useful at any time. Please use the web search functions available to you to research this as well. I would ultimately like a parallel orchestrated environment with several major models working together in tandem and bouncing ideas off each other, voting, debating, getting multiple opinions on direction, technique, priority, and so forth, and checking each others decisions and work and providing external guidance. Please try to ensure that the tools can be used for one main model to reach out and communicate with several other models independently which continue running in parallel somehow so that context is maintaned continously.

Please walk me through each MCP server and what it does, and whether it is truly useful to you. If it is not useful or if I decide not to use it yet please remove it from all config files. If it is useful and we want to use it, please make sure it is in all config files and works in all CLI tools.

I don't even know if I need/want a custom AI orchestrator script, doesn't zen mcp server already do this? Try to utilize what we already have!

Make sure no secret api keys are contained in files that may be added to git!

Please try to condense and remove unnecessary/outdated/redundant information, i.e. prune old md files.

Please also remove the unnecessary MCP servers from each config file.

JetBrains only works when WebStorm is open.

Codex was having MCP timeout issues due to environment variable whitelisting.

There are still hundreds of node, conhost, uv etc processes being created and not ending. Please make sure this is handled somehow.

Please evaluate and use MCP servers and tools as much as is reasonable in order to communicate and orchestrate parallel analysis with multiple major llm models through zen, analyze and debate the direction of the project and next steps, and store key information in chroma, memory, and serena memory. Use serena to access code and so forth as much as you can. Try to use as many CLI tools and models as you can, this is also a test of their configurations. Fixing errors as they come up may be helpful, especially collaborating with other models and using other CLI tools to fix errors in other tools!

Please view all the skill files in these directories, summarize them for instruction for all the AIs, and add the instructions to each specific AI model md file. Also include the concepts in the AI_COORDINATION directory in general and document the use and purpose of the AI orchestration scripts, and how relevant they are along with the current MCP stack. Please try to summarize each skill effectively without losing information.

C:\Users\hyper\fwber\AI_COORDINATION\skills\superpowers-main\skills

C:\Users\hyper\fwber\AI_COORDINATION\skills\superpowers-skills-main\skills

C:\Users\hyper\fwber\AI_COORDINATION\skills\the-elements-of-style-main\skills

and please also then document your summary/summaries in chroma, serena memory, and memory, along with md documentation in the project itself. This documentation will be used in the future for other projects to self-improve the multi-model orchestration development process.

Outstanding! Please continue! Reach out to several other major models and get their input on how to proceed, and delegate tasks through their respective CLI tools as appropriate!

Outstanding work. Please proceed. Make sure to communicate with other models, assign them tasks and have them do work through the CLI tools, and suse your MCP tools as effecticely as you can. Make recommendations to me along the way about what I could do to improve the process, if there are other/better tools I could install, and anything that you need from me on my end. If you encounter errors, use your resources to come up with solutions to solve them, or ask me to help. Let's gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

Role: Lead AI Orchestrator and Documentation Engineer

Primary Objective: Inventory, summarize, and operationalize all skills in the specified directories; integrate those summaries into model-specific instruction files; document orchestration scripts and their relevance to the current MCP stack; persist the knowledge in Chroma, Serena memory, and Memory MCP; coordinate with multiple external models via CLI tools to refine and validate results; produce a repeatable, versioned documentation set that future projects can use to self-improve multi-model orchestration.

Scope and resources:
- Skill directories to process:
  - C:\Users\hyper\fwber\AI_COORDINATION\skills\superpowers-main\skills
  - C:\Users\hyper\fwber\AI_COORDINATION\skills\superpowers-skills-main\skills
  - C:\Users\hyper\fwber\AI_COORDINATION\skills\the-elements-of-style-main\skills
- Orchestration scripts and configuration to analyze:
  - C:\Users\hyper\fwber\tools_config_files\
    - ai-orchestrator.js
    - cli_model_commands.json
    - enhanced_mcp_settings.json
    - claude.json, claude_mcp_template.json
    - copilot_mcp_template.json
    - cursor_mcp*.json
    - configure_all_models.ps1, deploy_config_files.ps1, create_config_links.ps1/.bat
    - ENHANCED_MCP_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md
    - test_all_mcp_servers.ps1
    - any additional *.json, *.yml, *.ps1 files
  - Root-level scripts:
    - comprehensive_mcp_test.ps1
    - final_mcp_verification.ps1
  - Other referenced configs:
    - tools_config_files/codex_config.toml
    - tools_config_files/serena_config.yml
- MCP servers/clients of interest:
  - chroma-knowledge, serena, memory, zen-mcp-server, sequential-thinking, everything, filesystem, gemini-mcp
- Prior context indicates Codex CLI timeouts; prioritize stability verification first.

Deliverables:
1) A complete, lossless-yet-concise summary for every skill file found under the three skill directories, following the Skill Summary Spec below.
2) Updated model instruction markdown files for each AI model in the repo, each with a new or updated “Skill Instructions” section tailored to that model’s capabilities and constraints. If a model MD file does not exist, create it.
3) A comprehensive document that explains:
   - The concepts in AI_COORDINATION (architecture, roles, control flow, data flow)
   - The purpose, usage, and relevance of each orchestration script to the current MCP stack
   - Known failure modes, prerequisites, and troubleshooting steps
4) Persisted summaries and docs into:
   - Chroma knowledge base (via chroma-knowledge MCP)
   - Serena memory MCP
   - Memory MCP
   Use consistent namespaces, metadata, and chunking strategy defined below.
5) A multi-model consensus report: inputs gathered from several major models via their CLI tools, the tasks delegated, their outputs, discrepancies, and the reconciled, final guidance.
6) A recommended improvements list for the user: environment setup, additional tools to install, configuration changes, and any support needed.
7) A repeatable runbook and repository docs:
   - docs/skills/index.md and per-skill docs
   - docs/orchestration/mcp_stack.md
   - docs/orchestration/scripts.md
   - docs/models/<model>.md (or updated)
   - CHANGELOG entry and a Git branch/commit with clear messages

Constraints and quality bar:
- Summaries must be compact but information-complete (no loss of intent, inputs/outputs, or safety constraints).
- Avoid exposing secrets; scrub tokens/IDs from configs and logs.
- Idempotent operations and robust error handling; retry transient failures, then log and escalate with actionable requests.
- Use existing CLI/MCP definitions; do not invent non-existent commands.
- Prefer minimal-risk configuration changes; propose reversible edits with verification steps.

Phase 1: Environment and MCP readiness
1) Run diagnostics and enumerate available MCP servers and CLI tools:
   - powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools_config_files\test_all_mcp_servers.ps1
   - powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\comprehensive_mcp_test.ps1
   - powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\final_mcp_verification.ps1
2) If any MCP client/server times out (e.g., chroma-knowledge, zen, memory, serena, sequential-thinking, everything, filesystem, gemini-mcp), capture:
   - Which servers failed, error messages, duration until timeout
   - Process path discovery: node, npx, uv, python, java, go availability and PATH
   - Config allowlist/environment mismatches in enhanced_mcp_settings.json, claude.json, cursor_mcp*.json, codex_config.toml
   - Port conflicts or firewall/antivirus blocks
3) Attempt minimal-risk remediations:
   - Ensure required runtimes in PATH: node, npm/npx, uv/pip, python
   - Validate config allowlists and paths to MCP servers/executables
   - Align model client configs (claude/cursor/copilot) with enhanced_mcp_settings.json
   - Update script execution policy and ensure PowerShell is allowed to run scripts
4) Re-run verification scripts and log results. If still failing, prepare a concise escalation note for the user with exact error outputs and a prioritized fix list.

Phase 2: Skill discovery and parsing
1) Recursively list all files in the three skill directories; include .md, .mdx, .json, .yaml/.yml, .toml, .py/.ts/.js where relevant to skills.
2) For each skill file, detect:
   - Skill name, description, inputs, outputs, side effects, dependencies, external APIs/tools, safety constraints, typical usage patterns, tags
3) Normalize data and prepare for summarization using the Skill Summary Spec.

Skill Summary Spec (apply to each skill):
- Name
- Category/Domain
- Purpose and high-level function
- Inputs (required/optional), shapes, defaults
- Outputs/Return values
- Core steps or algorithm
- External dependencies (APIs, files, MCP tools, CLI)
- Preconditions and postconditions
- Performance considerations and limits
- Safety/ethics/guardrails
- Error handling and edge cases
- Example usage and prompts
- Integration points with orchestration/MCP stack
- Related skills and alternatives
- File path and source provenance
Keep total length tight while retaining all critical information; prefer concise bullet points.

Phase 3: Model-specific instruction updates
1) Locate existing model markdowns in the repo (search for files likely named with model identifiers, e.g., claude.md, gpt-4*.md, gemini.md, serena.md, zen.md, copilot.md; also search for any *.model.md, *.ai.md, *.md in docs/models or project roots).
2) For each model, add or update a “Skill Instructions” section:
   - Curate the subset of skills most relevant to that model’s strengths and available MCP/CLI tools
   - Provide short, tailored how-to guidance for invoking skills via MCP or CLI
   - Note any model-specific constraints, rate limits, or token windows
   - Include troubleshooting notes specific to that model’s integration
3) If a model file doesn’t exist, create docs/models/<model>.md with:
   - Model overview and capabilities
   - MCP/CLI integration details (as configured in tools_config_files/*.json)
   - The curated Skill Instructions section

Phase 4: Orchestration scripts and MCP stack documentation
1) Inventory and document scripts and configs under tools_config_files and root-level *.ps1:
   - Purpose, when to use, prerequisites, how to run, expected outputs
   - How each relates to MCP servers and client configurations
   - Known failure modes and remediation
2) Produce:
   - docs/orchestration/mcp_stack.md: architecture, active servers, data flow, auth/allowlists, ports, dependencies
   - docs/orchestration/scripts.md: per-script runbook, usage examples, verification steps
   - Update ENHANCED_MCP_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md if present, or create a cross-reference section to it

Phase 5: Persist knowledge to Chroma, Serena memory, and Memory MCP
1) Chunking and metadata policy:
   - Chunk size ~800–1200 tokens with semantic boundaries
   - Metadata: title, path, source repo, skill_category, tags, model_targets, version, timestamp, hash
   - Namespace: skills for skill summaries; orchestration for MCP/docs
2) Write operations:
   - Chroma (chroma-knowledge MCP): upsert all chunks with metadata; create collections skills and orchestration if not present
   - Serena memory MCP: write summaries with tags [skills], [orchestration]; include backlinks to repo paths
   - Memory MCP: record short abstracts plus pointers to full docs; tag with [index]
3) Verify persistence by querying a few representative entries and logging matches.

Phase 6: Multi-model collaboration and delegation via CLI tools
1) Read tools_config_files/cli_model_commands.json to learn the exact CLI invocation patterns per model.
2) Engage at least three major models (e.g., Claude, OpenAI/GPT, Gemini, local LLM via Ollama or similar if configured) to:
   - Review the Skill Summary Spec and propose refinements
   - Validate two randomly selected skills per directory for completeness and clarity
   - Propose improvements to the orchestration documentation
3) Delegate tasks via their CLI tools in parallel where possible; capture raw outputs and synthesize a consensus:
   - Note disagreements, choose final formulations, and document rationale
4) Append a “Peer Feedback and Consensus” section at the end of docs/skills/index.md and docs/orchestration/mcp_stack.md.

Phase 7: Repo documentation and structure
1) Write or update:
   - docs/skills/index.md: overview, taxonomy, cross-links to per-skill summaries
   - docs/skills/<skill-name>.md for each skill
   - docs/orchestration/mcp_stack.md and docs/orchestration/scripts.md as defined above
   - docs/models/<model>.md with updated “Skill Instructions”
   - A top-level README update with pointers to new docs
2) Ensure internal links use relative paths and work on Windows
3) Maintain a consistent style guide; if the-elements-of-style-main includes writing guidance, apply it to summaries

Phase 8: Verification, versioning, and handoff
1) Re-run final_mcp_verification.ps1; ensure no timeouts and log results
2) Create a Git branch: docs/skills-orchestration-<date>
3) Commit changes with messages summarizing:
   - Skills summarized and docs added
   - Model instruction updates
   - MCP stack docs
   - Memory/Chroma persistence
4) Generate a brief test plan and acceptance report:
   - Every skill has a summary and is indexed in Chroma/Serena/Memory
   - Each model doc contains updated Skill Instructions
   - Orchestration docs capture current MCP state and scripts usage
   - Multi-model feedback incorporated and conflicts resolved
5) Provide a final status note with next steps and any open questions.

Recommendations and requests to the user (update dynamically as you proceed):
- Confirm installation and PATH availability of node, npm/npx, python, uv, and any runtime required by MCP servers
- Allow PowerShell script execution (ExecutionPolicy Bypass for this repo only)
- If firewalls/AV interfere with MCP server ports, create local allow rules
- Optionally install:
   - uv (for Python envs)
   - Ollama or equivalent local LLM runtime if desired
   - Chroma DB service if running standalone
- Provide any missing API keys via secure local env files; never commit secrets

Error handling and escalation:
- On failure, capture exact command, environment, and error output
- Attempt up to two automated remediations; then pause and request user input with a concise, prioritized action list
- Do not proceed with destructive changes without explicit confirmation

Start now. Prioritize MCP readiness checks, then perform skill discovery and summarization, persist to memories, coordinate external model reviews, finalize docs, and submit the verification and handoff report.

Please then continue analyzing the project and determine the best course of progress and continue pursuing that direction utilizing all of your skills, knowledge, and abilities to the best you are capable, and continue to proceed as you recommend until further notice.

Operational Policy and Playbook for Multi-Model Orchestration (FWBer)
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2025-10-17
Purpose and Scope
- Deliver a secure, reliable, parallel orchestration environment on Windows for FWBer and future projects.
- Use stable MCP servers and CLIs that are already working; minimize custom orchestration by default.
- Standardize environment variables, paths, security, error handling, and logging across tools and servers.
Project Roots and Paths (Windows)
- PROJECT_ROOT: C:\Users\hyper\fwber
- AI_COORDINATION_DIR: C:\Users\hyper\fwber\AI_COORDINATION
- MCP_CONFIG_PATH: C:\Users\hyper\fwber\tools_config_files\enhanced_mcp_settings.json
- MCP_FILESYSTEM_ROOTS: C:\Users\hyper\fwber
- USERPROFILE: C:\Users\hyper
Secrets and API Keys (set via environment, not files)
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- OPENAI_ORG (optional)
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- GEMINI_API_KEY
- XAI_API_KEY (Grok)
- OPENROUTER_API_KEY (optional)
- POSTGRES_URL (optional; only if database tools are enabled)
Current Tooling and Model Inventory (prioritized)
- Primary models: Claude 4.5; GPT-5-Codex (low/medium/high); GPT-5 (variants); Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash; Cheetah; Code Supernova 1M; Grok 4 Code, Grok Code Fast 1.
- Active CLIs/Tools: Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, Grok CLI (needs API key), Serena MCP, Sequential Thinking MCP, Codex MCP, Gemini MCP Tool.
- IDE Integrations: Cursor + plugins (Cline, Claude Code, Codex); JetBrains WebStorm MCP disabled by policy until stable.
- Optional orchestration: Custom AI Orchestrator script is present but disabled by default in MCP config. Use only if you need bespoke flows; otherwise prefer Serena + model MCPs.
MCP Server Selection and Policy
- Enabled (stable): serena, sequential-thinking, codex-mcp-server, gemini-mcp-tool
- Disabled (policy or stability): jetbrains (requires IDE runtime; prior timeouts)
- Least-privilege paths: allowedPaths restricted to C:\Users\hyper\fwber
- Timeouts and retries (defaults): timeoutMs=30s, startupTimeoutMs=60s, maxRetries=2, backoff base=500ms, factor=2.0, max=15s, jitter on
- Health checks: Use "--version" or "--help" where available; otherwise disable healthCheck
Codex CLI Environment Allowlist (no bypass, explicit policy)
- File: C:\Users\hyper\.codex\config.toml
- Minimal allowlist (recommended):
[security]
env_allowlist = [
  "PROJECT_ROOT",
  "MCP_CONFIG_PATH",
  "MCP_FILESYSTEM_ROOTS",
  "OPENAI_API_KEY",
  "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
  "GEMINI_API_KEY",
  "XAI_API_KEY",
  "OPENROUTER_API_KEY",
  "USERPROFILE",
  "PATH"
]
filesystem_roots = ["C:\\Users\\hyper\\fwber"]
- Secure-expanded allowlist (opt-in after validation):
[security.expanded]
env_allowlist = [
  "PROJECT_ROOT",
  "AI_COORDINATION_DIR",
  "MCP_CONFIG_PATH",
  "MCP_FILESYSTEM_ROOTS",
  "SERENA_HOME",
  "ZEN_HOME",
  "OPENAI_API_KEY",
  "OPENAI_ORG",
  "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
  "GEMINI_API_KEY",
  "XAI_API_KEY",
  "OPENROUTER_API_KEY",
  "POSTGRES_URL",
  "USERPROFILE",
  "PATH"
]
filesystem_roots = ["C:\\Users\\hyper\\fwber"]
Operational Defaults for Orchestration
- Prefer orchestration via Serena MCP, Sequential Thinking MCP, and native provider MCPs.
- Custom orchestrator [AIOrchestrator.orchestrateTask()](tools_config_files/ai-orchestrator.js:80) is available but disabled in MCP settings by default. Enable only if you need advanced parallel policies not provided by your active MCPs.
- Concurrency: 4 sessions max (configurable by AI_MAX_CONCURRENCY)
- Task timeout: 5 minutes (AI_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS=300000)
- Model timeout: 30 seconds (AI_MODEL_TIMEOUT_MS=30000)
- Retries: 2 with exponential backoff + jitter
- Circuit breaker: open after 3 fails in 2 minutes; 5-minute cooldown
Security and Privacy Practices
- Store secrets only in environment variables; never commit keys to version control.
- Redact secrets from all logs (enable AI_LOG_REDACT=1).
- Restrict filesystem access to C:\Users\hyper\fwber unless explicitly opted in.
- Use least-privilege env allowlists for MCP clients (Codex, etc.).
- Limit high-risk flags ("full-auto", raw mode) and prefer "secure" profiles defined in CLI configs.
Structured Logging and Auditing
- Enable JSONL logs with AI_LOG_JSONL=1
- Log file: C:\Users\hyper\fwber\AI_COORDINATION\logs\orchestrator.jsonl
- Rotation: rotate at 10 MB or 10,000 events; keep 5 rotations; 14-day retention
- Event keys: ts, level, event, taskId, model, durationMs, attempt, outcome, error, meta
- Sample events: task_started, model_consult_started, model_consult_finished, consensus_finalized, task_completed, task_failed
Standard Operating Workflow (Recommended)
1) Verify MCP servers
- Validate serena, codex-mcp-server, gemini-mcp-tool, sequential-thinking with simple "--help" or version commands.
- If any fail, investigate timeouts, network, or package availability.
2) Verify CLIs and Authentication
- Codex: codex login status
- Gemini: gemini auth status
- Grok: set XAI_API_KEY and run "grok --help" (Grok CLI is unofficial; keep it isolated and minimal privileges)
3) Use Model-Specific CLI for Primary Tasks
- Implementation: codex exec --model gpt-5-codex-high "Implement feature X"
- Architecture: gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro "Analyze scalability needs"
- Cross-check with another model via MCP tooling or second CLI
4) Use Serena MCP for Contextual Code Ops
- Symbol overviews, references, memory-backed summaries; constrain filesystem paths
5) Parallel Perspectives (Optional)
- If you need multiple models in parallel with weighted consensus, either:
  - Use Serena + provider MCP tools to collect multiple opinions; or
  - Enable the custom orchestrator (disabled by default) and route tasks through it with limited concurrency and auditing
6) Documentation and Change Capture
- Append decisions to shared logs; periodically persist summaries via Serena memory or a dedicated doc
Recommended Policies per Task Type
- Implementation: GPT-5-Codex (high), plus Grok (fast code) as secondary if API key configured
- Architecture/Reasoning: Claude 4.5 + Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Creative/Brainstorming: Gemini 2.5 Flash + Claude 4.5
- Performance Optimization: Cheetah + GPT-5-Codex High
- Large Context/Continuity: Code Supernova 1M + Claude 4.5
Troubleshooting Quick Reference
- Timeouts starting MCP servers: Increase startupTimeoutMs to 90s; validate Node/NPX/UV availability; check PATH issues.
- JetBrains MCP "connection refused/closed": Keep disabled unless WebStorm is running and reachable; use HTTP/SSE only if required and stable.
- Codex "env whitelist" failures: Confirm [security] env_allowlist includes required names; avoid wildcarding.
- Package not found (NPM): Use exact package names; if community package fails, pin version or temporarily disable that server.
- Windows console encoding: Prefer UTF-8 (chcp 65001) for certain installers; or avoid installers that emit Unicode glyphs if they break.
Performance and Reliability
- Keep maxConcurrentSessions modest (e.g., 4) to avoid rate limits and local resource contention.
- Use retries sparingly; respect provider rate limits and backoff.
- Circuit breaker prevents thrashing on flaky providers; observe cooldowns before re-enabling.
When to Enable the Custom Orchestrator
- You need strict, policy-driven routing, per-model quotas, explicit consensus math, or audit trails beyond what current MCP servers provide.
- To enable: set "claude-code-orchestrator.enabled" to true in [tools_config_files/enhanced_mcp_settings.json](tools_config_files/enhanced_mcp_settings.json) and ensure environment variables for logging and directories are set.
WSL vs Native Windows
- Prefer native Windows paths already used in all configurations.
- If you opt into WSL tools, ensure consistent path translation and env allowlists; avoid mixing both within the same command chain.
Acceptance Checklist for Any New Tool/Server
- Paths: only absolute Windows paths; no ~
- Env: documented names only; keys set via OS, not hardcoded
- Security: least-privilege allowlists; no broad roots
- Logging: redact secrets; structured JSONL if enabled
- Timeouts and retries: 30s/60s with 2 retries and exponential backoff
- Health checks: "--version/--help" or disabled with justification
Change Log
- 1.1.0 (2025-10-17)
  - Rewrote this file into an operational policy with security, orchestration workflow, Codex env allowlist, and troubleshooting guide
  - Standardized Windows paths (mrgen → hyper)
  - Set JetBrains MCP disabled by default; custom orchestrator disabled by default
  - Introduced JSONL structured logging and rotation guidance
