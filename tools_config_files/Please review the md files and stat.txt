Please review the md files and state of the project, summarize it, and get back to me. I would also like to condense and simplify this project as much as possible, so please take that into consideration. I will be using several IDEs, IDE plugins, and CLI tools for the various major LLMs to work on this project, including Cursor, WebStorm, Github Copilot, Cline, Gemini, Claude, Grok, JetBrains AI, OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Github Copilot CLI, Grok CLI, etc. I am also using Serena MCP. Ideally I could get you all to interoperate together somehow to bounce ideas off each other and check each others' work, including myself in the process at times. Please advise on what a good way to do that might be, perhaps MCP configurations between each other, or an AI log file that you all use to communicate, etc. If this approach is successful I will be using it for several more projects, so I would like to come up with an effective and efficient workflow. Thank you very much!

I am currently evaluating all the major AI models, CLI tools, IDEs, IDE plugins, and MCP servers. My ultimate goal is to configure them all together in order to create a super powerful mega AI which communicates between several models and orchestrates multiple models and tools together in parallel, in order to debate, brainstorm, and assign tasks and work as a team maybe with subagents, hopefully in order to produce better ideas and results. Currently I am starting with codex CLI, please check its configuration. The config files are listed in the nppsession file. I believe it is having MCP timeout errors due to environment variable whitelisting. Please try to correct this in the config file and Cursor's settings. Codex seems to want to use WSL, which is fine but I need help configuring it in that case. Powershell and cmd are also both fine. I would then like to move on to more CLI tools, trying to make sure that each CLI tool and IDE has access to as many models as possible, that they all are configured with the same MCP servers and tools, and that they all work if possible, and they are able to call out to all other major models in several ways and use the other CLI tools, and also utilize all the MCP servers and tools when and where useful. Ultimately I want to use this super development AI team to help me to complete FWBer and then move on to more projects. Please begin with codex and bypass the environment variable whitelist somehow so that it can access the tools in its config file. Please also suggest any other tools, techniques, CLI tools, IDE, model, or especially MCP server which you think would be useful at any time. Please use the web search functions available to you to research this as well.
Please walk me through each MCP server and what it does, and whether it is truly useful to you. If it is not useful or if I decide not to use it yet please remove it from all config files. If it is useful and we want to use it, please make sure it is in all config files and works in all CLI tools.

Operational Policy and Playbook for Multi-Model Orchestration (FWBer)
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2025-10-17
Purpose and Scope
- Deliver a secure, reliable, parallel orchestration environment on Windows for FWBer and future projects.
- Use stable MCP servers and CLIs that are already working; minimize custom orchestration by default.
- Standardize environment variables, paths, security, error handling, and logging across tools and servers.
Project Roots and Paths (Windows)
- PROJECT_ROOT: C:\Users\hyper\fwber
- AI_COORDINATION_DIR: C:\Users\hyper\fwber\AI_COORDINATION
- MCP_CONFIG_PATH: C:\Users\hyper\fwber\tools_config_files\enhanced_mcp_settings.json
- MCP_FILESYSTEM_ROOTS: C:\Users\hyper\fwber
- USERPROFILE: C:\Users\hyper
Secrets and API Keys (set via environment, not files)
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- OPENAI_ORG (optional)
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- GEMINI_API_KEY
- XAI_API_KEY (Grok)
- OPENROUTER_API_KEY (optional)
- POSTGRES_URL (optional; only if database tools are enabled)
Current Tooling and Model Inventory (prioritized)
- Primary models: Claude 4.5; GPT-5-Codex (low/medium/high); GPT-5 (variants); Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash; Cheetah; Code Supernova 1M; Grok 4 Code, Grok Code Fast 1.
- Active CLIs/Tools: Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, Grok CLI (needs API key), Serena MCP, Sequential Thinking MCP, Codex MCP, Gemini MCP Tool.
- IDE Integrations: Cursor + plugins (Cline, Claude Code, Codex); JetBrains WebStorm MCP disabled by policy until stable.
- Optional orchestration: Custom AI Orchestrator script is present but disabled by default in MCP config. Use only if you need bespoke flows; otherwise prefer Serena + model MCPs.
MCP Server Selection and Policy
- Enabled (stable): serena, sequential-thinking, codex-mcp-server, gemini-mcp-tool
- Disabled (policy or stability): jetbrains (requires IDE runtime; prior timeouts)
- Least-privilege paths: allowedPaths restricted to C:\Users\hyper\fwber
- Timeouts and retries (defaults): timeoutMs=30s, startupTimeoutMs=60s, maxRetries=2, backoff base=500ms, factor=2.0, max=15s, jitter on
- Health checks: Use “--version” or “--help” where available; otherwise disable healthCheck
Codex CLI Environment Allowlist (no bypass, explicit policy)
- File: C:\Users\hyper\.codex\config.toml
- Minimal allowlist (recommended):
[security]
env_allowlist = [
  "PROJECT_ROOT",
  "MCP_CONFIG_PATH",
  "MCP_FILESYSTEM_ROOTS",
  "OPENAI_API_KEY",
  "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
  "GEMINI_API_KEY",
  "XAI_API_KEY",
  "OPENROUTER_API_KEY",
  "USERPROFILE",
  "PATH"
]
filesystem_roots = ["C:\\Users\\hyper\\fwber"]
- Secure-expanded allowlist (opt-in after validation):
[security.expanded]
env_allowlist = [
  "PROJECT_ROOT",
  "AI_COORDINATION_DIR",
  "MCP_CONFIG_PATH",
  "MCP_FILESYSTEM_ROOTS",
  "SERENA_HOME",
  "ZEN_HOME",
  "OPENAI_API_KEY",
  "OPENAI_ORG",
  "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
  "GEMINI_API_KEY",
  "XAI_API_KEY",
  "OPENROUTER_API_KEY",
  "POSTGRES_URL",
  "USERPROFILE",
  "PATH"
]
filesystem_roots = ["C:\\Users\\hyper\\fwber"]
Operational Defaults for Orchestration
- Prefer orchestration via Serena MCP, Sequential Thinking MCP, and native provider MCPs.
- Custom orchestrator [AIOrchestrator.orchestrateTask()](tools_config_files/ai-orchestrator.js:80) is available but disabled in MCP settings by default. Enable only if you need advanced parallel policies not provided by your active MCPs.
- Concurrency: 4 sessions max (configurable by AI_MAX_CONCURRENCY)
- Task timeout: 5 minutes (AI_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS=300000)
- Model timeout: 30 seconds (AI_MODEL_TIMEOUT_MS=30000)
- Retries: 2 with exponential backoff + jitter
- Circuit breaker: open after 3 fails in 2 minutes; 5-minute cooldown
Security and Privacy Practices
- Store secrets only in environment variables; never commit keys to version control.
- Redact secrets from all logs (enable AI_LOG_REDACT=1).
- Restrict filesystem access to C:\Users\hyper\fwber unless explicitly opted in.
- Use least-privilege env allowlists for MCP clients (Codex, etc.).
- Limit high-risk flags (“full-auto”, raw mode) and prefer “secure” profiles defined in CLI configs.
Structured Logging and Auditing
- Enable JSONL logs with AI_LOG_JSONL=1
- Log file: C:\Users\hyper\fwber\AI_COORDINATION\logs\orchestrator.jsonl
- Rotation: rotate at 10 MB or 10,000 events; keep 5 rotations; 14-day retention
- Event keys: ts, level, event, taskId, model, durationMs, attempt, outcome, error, meta
- Sample events: task_started, model_consult_started, model_consult_finished, consensus_finalized, task_completed, task_failed
Standard Operating Workflow (Recommended)
1) Verify MCP servers
- Validate serena, codex-mcp-server, gemini-mcp-tool, sequential-thinking with simple “--help” or version commands.
- If any fail, investigate timeouts, network, or package availability.
2) Verify CLIs and Authentication
- Codex: codex login status
- Gemini: gemini auth status
- Grok: set XAI_API_KEY and run “grok --help” (Grok CLI is unofficial; keep it isolated and minimal privileges)
3) Use Model-Specific CLI for Primary Tasks
- Implementation: codex exec --model gpt-5-codex-high "Implement feature X"
- Architecture: gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro "Analyze scalability needs"
- Cross-check with another model via MCP tooling or second CLI
4) Use Serena MCP for Contextual Code Ops
- Symbol overviews, references, memory-backed summaries; constrain filesystem paths
5) Parallel Perspectives (Optional)
- If you need multiple models in parallel with weighted consensus, either:
  - Use Serena + provider MCP tools to collect multiple opinions; or
  - Enable the custom orchestrator (disabled by default) and route tasks through it with limited concurrency and auditing
6) Documentation and Change Capture
- Append decisions to shared logs; periodically persist summaries via Serena memory or a dedicated doc
Recommended Policies per Task Type
- Implementation: GPT-5-Codex (high), plus Grok (fast code) as secondary if API key configured
- Architecture/Reasoning: Claude 4.5 + Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Creative/Brainstorming: Gemini 2.5 Flash + Claude 4.5
- Performance Optimization: Cheetah + GPT-5-Codex High
- Large Context/Continuity: Code Supernova 1M + Claude 4.5
Troubleshooting Quick Reference
- Timeouts starting MCP servers: Increase startupTimeoutMs to 90s; validate Node/NPX/UV availability; check PATH issues.
- JetBrains MCP “connection refused/closed”: Keep disabled unless WebStorm is running and reachable; use HTTP/SSE only if required and stable.
- Codex “env whitelist” failures: Confirm [security] env_allowlist includes required names; avoid wildcarding.
- Package not found (NPM): Use exact package names; if community package fails, pin version or temporarily disable that server.
- Windows console encoding: Prefer UTF-8 (chcp 65001) for certain installers; or avoid installers that emit Unicode glyphs if they break.
Performance and Reliability
- Keep maxConcurrentSessions modest (e.g., 4) to avoid rate limits and local resource contention.
- Use retries sparingly; respect provider rate limits and backoff.
- Circuit breaker prevents thrashing on flaky providers; observe cooldowns before re-enabling.
When to Enable the Custom Orchestrator
- You need strict, policy-driven routing, per-model quotas, explicit consensus math, or audit trails beyond what current MCP servers provide.
- To enable: set “claude-code-orchestrator.enabled” to true in [tools_config_files/enhanced_mcp_settings.json](tools_config_files/enhanced_mcp_settings.json) and ensure environment variables for logging and directories are set.
WSL vs Native Windows
- Prefer native Windows paths already used in all configurations.
- If you opt into WSL tools, ensure consistent path translation and env allowlists; avoid mixing both within the same command chain.
Acceptance Checklist for Any New Tool/Server
- Paths: only absolute Windows paths; no ~
- Env: documented names only; keys set via OS, not hardcoded
- Security: least-privilege allowlists; no broad roots
- Logging: redact secrets; structured JSONL if enabled
- Timeouts and retries: 30s/60s with 2 retries and exponential backoff
- Health checks: “--version/--help” or disabled with justification
