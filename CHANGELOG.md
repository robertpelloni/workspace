# Changelog

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-19
### Changed
- **Documentation Architecture:** Replaced individual model instructions with a centralized `docs/UNIVERSAL_LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and updated `GEMINI.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GPT.md`, and `AGENTS.md` to reference it.
- **Global Synchronization:** Successfully ran `update_repos_v3.py` across 500+ repositories, syncing with origins and merging viable upstream changes.
- **Repo Repair:** Re-initialized and fixed broken submodules (`qwen.project`, `cointrade`, `metamcp`, `bobeditpro`).
- **Conflict Resolution:** Manually resolved complex "detached HEAD" states and purged API keys from `metamcp` history.
- **Cleanup:** Removed large binary files (`antigravity-autopilot.7z`) and stale worktrees (`.borg` folders) that were blocking pushes.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-02-18
- Initial recursive submodule updates and conflict detection.
