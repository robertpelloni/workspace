# Changelog

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-19
### Added
- **Phase 2 Implementation:** Created `scripts/propagate_instructions.py` which resiliently pushed the `docs/UNIVERSAL_LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` to **1,558** repositories and submodules across the entire workspace tree.
- **Recursive Dashboarding:** Upgraded `scripts/generate_dashboard.py` to recursively map every sub-submodule, providing total visibility into the fleet's branch and commit status.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-19
### Changed
- **Documentation Architecture:** Replaced individual model instructions with a centralized `docs/UNIVERSAL_LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and updated `GEMINI.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GPT.md`, and `AGENTS.md` to reference it.
- **Global Synchronization:** Successfully ran `update_repos_v3.py` across 500+ repositories, syncing with origins and merging viable upstream changes.
- **Repo Repair:** Re-initialized and fixed broken submodules (`qwen.project`, `cointrade`, `metamcp`, `bobeditpro`).
- **Conflict Resolution:** Manually resolved complex "detached HEAD" states and purged API keys from `metamcp` history.
- **Cleanup:** Removed large binary files (`antigravity-autopilot.7z`) and stale worktrees (`.borg` folders) that were blocking pushes.
